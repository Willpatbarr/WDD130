    <h2>William Barr</h2>
    <h3>Will or Willie</h3>
    <p>Hey! I'm William, or Will, or Willie. I don't have much of a preference. I'm from a small town northwest of Boise called Middleton. Last semester I was majoring in Mechanical Engineering, but this semester I changed to majoring in Software Engineering with a minor in Small Business Management and Innovation. </p>
    <p>I really enjoy anything active like sports or hiking/backpacking. I've played soccer my whole life and it is easily my favorite sport. I also really enjoy nutrition and learning about how I can be healthier and reach goals I've set for myself.</p>
    <p>I love attending BYU-I becuase of the atmosphere here and the proffesors. I always feel like me learning the material is more important here than just spending my money. I also love Rexburg and all the different things there are to do here.</p>
